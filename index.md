I am currently a fourth year student at the University of British Columbia pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in statistics, with a thematic concentration in computer science. I am interested in research in machine learning and bayesian statistics in general, and intend to pursue graduate studies in statistics.

Currently, I am working with Dr. Trevor Campbell from the Statistics Department at UBC on Optimization Methods in Bayesian Inference as an undergraduate research assistant.

Apart from academics, I enjoy playing tennis, and work actively as a certified official with Tennis Canada.
