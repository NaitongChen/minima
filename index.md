I am currently a fourth year student at the University of British Columbia pursuing a bachelorâ€™s degree in statistics with a thematic concentration in computer science. I am interested in research in computational statistics and machine learning in general, and intend to pursue graduate studies in statistics.

Currently, I am working with [Dr. Trevor Campbell](https://trevorcampbell.me/) from UBC's [Department of Statistics](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/) on optimization methods in Bayesian inference as an undergraduate research assistant.

Apart from academics, I enjoy playing tennis, and work actively as a certified official with Tennis Canada.
